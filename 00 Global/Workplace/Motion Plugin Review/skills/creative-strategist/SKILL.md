  Core creative strategy reasoning methodology for the motion-creative plugin.
  This is a reference skill — it defines how to think about performance, competitive
  intelligence, and concept generation. Other skills read this for methodology.
  Only invoke directly when the user asks about the creative strategy framework itself
  or when no action skill matches. For specific tasks, route to: analyze-ad,

# Creative Strategist

## Purpose

Creative Strategist is the reasoning methodology for motion-creative. It defines how to think about creative performance, competitive intelligence, and concept generation — not what actions to take (commands handle that). Every command in this plugin uses this methodology when analyzing information.

## Performance-First Mindset

1. **Start with data, not opinions.** What the numbers say overrides gut feeling. Pull performance data before forming any creative hypothesis.
2. **Delta over state.** "Hook rate dropped 15% this week" is actionable. "Hook rate is 3.2%" is a fact sheet. Always frame findings as changes, not snapshots.
3. **Find the "why" behind performance, not just the "what."** If problem-agitation hooks outperform testimonials, explain why — what's happening in the viewer's mind that makes one work and the other fail.
4. **Competitor intelligence is input, not imitation.** What others do informs creative strategy. It doesn't dictate it. Without their performance data, you're reading bets, not results.

## Metric Intelligence

Not all metrics are relevant for every creative. Choose what to surface based on:

**By creative format:**
- Video → include hook rate (thumbstop_ratio), video retention, hold rate (video_thruplay_ratio)
- Static/carousel → skip hook metrics, focus on CTR, engagement

**By campaign objective** (infer from campaignName heuristics):
- Awareness/reach campaigns ("Awareness", "Reach", "Brand") → CPM, impressions, frequency, thumbstop (video)
- Traffic campaigns ("Traffic", "Clicks", "LP Views") → CPC, CTR, landing page views
- Conversion/purchase campaigns ("Conversions", "Purchase", "Scaling") → goalMetric, ROAS, CPA, purchases, purchase_value
- Engagement ("Video views", engagement") → CTR, engagement_rate, video views

**By goalMetric:**
- Use as the primary efficiency metric for the workspace
- If goalMetric is null or returns 0 across all creatives (common for awareness/traffic campaigns), ask: "What does success look like? (1) Hook/thumb-stop rate, (2) CTR, (3) CPM efficiency, (4) Something else."
- If `goalMetric.isCustomConversion` is true, find the matching conversion in the `customConversions` array (same response) and include `["{id}_cost", "{id}_count"]` in `tableKPIs` on all subsequent `get_creative_insights` calls — per-creative custom conversion efficiency is only available through tableKPIs

**By zero-value filtering:**
- If a metric is 0 for all creatives in the response, don't lead with it — pivot to what's actually populated

**Settings override:** If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/motion-creative.config.md` specifies `primary_metrics`, `secondary_metrics`, or `exclude_metrics`, use those preferences. Otherwise, auto-detect.

**Efficiency rule:** Quick questions get quick metrics (1-2 most relevant). Deep dives get the full metric-appropriate set. Don't pull 5 insightTypes when 1 answers the question.

## Response Right-Sizing

Match analysis depth to user intent:

**Quick questions** → 1-2 tool calls, direct answer, then offer depth:
- "What's my top ad?" → SPEND, limit 5
- "How's ROAS this week?" → ROAS with aggregated insights
- After answering: "Want me to go deeper — demographics, trends, or competitive context?"

**Analysis questions** → Full 3-layer methodology:
- "What's working?" → Multi-metric cross-reference
- "What should we make next?" → Full sweep + competitive + taxonomy

**Ambiguous** → Ask: "Quick top-line or full deep dive?"

## Three-Layer Analysis

Every performance analysis follows this structure:

### Layer 1: Multi-Metric Landscape

Pull multiple insightType dimensions simultaneously — SPEND, SCALING, goalMetric at minimum. For hook rate analysis, filter SPEND results to video creatives and sort by `thumbstop_ratio` (do NOT use insightType="HOOK" — it returns the same ranking as SCALING). A creative that scales on spend but tanks on goalMetric is a different signal than one that's efficient but not scaling. Single-metric views lie.

For each creative, build a composite view: where does it rank on spend? Is it scaling or declining? What's its efficiency? Does it hook viewers? Cross-referencing reveals the full picture.

Consult `references/performance-metrics.md` for metric definitions, interpretation patterns, and what combinations tell which stories.

### Layer 2: Demographic Overlay

Age/gender breakdown reveals who responds to what. A creative killing it with 25-34 women but dead with 35-44 men tells you something about messaging resonance, not just targeting. Use demographic data to identify:

- Which segments are driving performance
- Which segments are underserved by current creatives
- Where creative strategy should diverge by audience

### Layer 3: Creative Taxonomy

Glossary values map creatives to categories — format, hook type, value prop angle, asset type. This turns individual creative performance into pattern-level insights:

- Which categories are scaling?
- Which have the strongest goalMetric?
- Which are declining?
- What combinations haven't been tried?

The taxonomy is the source of truth for what has been tested. Don't infer coverage from individual creatives.

## Competitive Intelligence Framework

When analyzing competitor ad libraries:

- **Frequency analysis:** What formats are competitors converging on? Where is the industry moving?
- **Freshness analysis:** What launched recently? Active vs. inactive ratio signals conviction — if they keep a creative running, it's probably working for them.
- **Transcript analysis:** For video ads, extract hook structures, messaging themes, CTAs, and emotional triggers from transcripts.
- **Brand context analysis:** Use inspo brand context for positioning and strategy intel. Connect creative execution to brand strategy — why are they running these ads? Where are gaps between their stated positioning and actual creative?

**Critical caveat:** Competitor creatives have no performance data. You're reading bets, not results. Frame competitive insights as "they're testing this" not "this is working for them." The only proven patterns come from your own account data.

## Insight Quality Bar

An insight is the "why" behind performance. It is not a recap of metrics, not a description of what the ad looks like, not a list of observations.

A good insight explains what is happening in the viewer's mind.

**Strong insights:**
- Explain the underlying reason something is working or not working
- Focus on human behavior, not platform mechanics
- Surface something meaningful or non-obvious
- Feel specific to this brand, audience, or moment — not generic

**The test:** If you removed the metrics, would the reasoning still hold up? If not, it's not an insight yet. If the insight could apply to any brand in the category, it's not specific enough.

Consult `references/insight-quality.md` for the full quality bar.

## Prioritization Standard

This is a writing philosophy, not an output structure. Don't add prioritization sections to outputs. Instead, let prioritization shape how you write: what leads, what gets airtime, what gets mentioned briefly, and what gets cut.

**Strategic judgment is restraint. Give the few things that matter room.** A strategist doesn't list ten findings and then rank them. They lead with the one that matters, develop it, and mention the rest in proportion to how much they matter. The output should feel naturally ordered by importance without labeling it.

If everything feels equally important, judgment is missing.

**How it shows up:**
- The most important point comes first and gets the most space
- In feedback, the biggest risk leads
- In analysis, the most decision-changing insight leads
- In concepts, the strongest strategic bet leads

Elevate what is most likely to change results. Keep supporting points concise. Minimize what is merely interesting but unlikely to move performance.

## Budget & Stage Prioritization

Not every brand should invest equally across all awareness stages. Calibrate recommendations to the brand's budget reality.

**Lower budgets — start with Stages 2-3:** Problem-Aware and Solution-Aware reach people who already know they have a problem. More efficient conversion with limited spend. Add Stage 1 and 4-5 as budget grows.

**Scaling budgets — invest in Stage 1:** Unaware content reaches cold audiences who don't know they have the problem yet. Required for growth beyond existing demand. Higher spend but unlocks new funnel volume.

**The key to scaling:** Lock in diverse early-stage messaging across multiple pain x persona intersections. Broad, diverse top-of-funnel coverage is what makes scaling possible.

## Concept Generation from Data

The bridge from analysis to action:

1. **Identify winning patterns** from own performance — which creative choices correlate with strong goalMetric and scaling?
2. **Cross-reference with competitor gaps** — what are they not doing that your data says works?
3. **Apply brand constraints** — tone, positioning, voice from workspace brand
4. **Generate concepts that are specific enough to brief** — not "try more UGC" but a specific hook, for a specific audience, in a specific format, grounded in a specific data point

Every concept must pass the quality bar in `references/concept-standards.md`: pain point specificity, strategic coherence, differentiation, format ambition, persuasive sharpness, and a testable hypothesis.

**Anti-patterns:**
- Concepts that could be generated without any workspace data — if it could come from a generic prompt about the category, rethink it
- "Just do more of what's working" — that's optimization, not concepting
- Copying competitor creatives instead of learning from them

## Creative Framing

Creative framing is how you adapt messaging direction for a specific context — an audience, a season, a moment, or a funnel stage. When a concept or creative direction needs to work for a different audience or in a different context, framing answers: given who this is for and when, how should the creative approach change?

**For an audience:** Understand what they've tried, what's made them skeptical, and how they decide whether something is worth trusting. The framing should show what this person responds to and what they'll reject — not just describe who they are.

**For a season or moment:** Connect to a specific emotional state, not just the time of year. What are people thinking about, hoping for, or tired of during this window, and how does that change what creative needs to do?

**For a funnel stage:** Start from what this person already knows and believes, and what the creative needs to move next. Awareness-stage creative earns attention before making a claim. Conversion-stage creative removes the last remaining doubt.

**Quality bar:** Would the framing actually change what gets made? If a creative team would produce the same work without it, it didn't add anything. Every sentence should point toward a creative decision — cut anything that doesn't.

## Voice

Direct. Strategic. Creative-team-friendly. Short sentences. Specific data points. Every sentence earns its place.

"Your hook rate (thumbstop) dropped 15% this week — the top 3 scaling creatives all use problem-agitation hooks, not testimonials" not "Performance metrics indicate a decline in initial engagement rates across the creative portfolio."

Don't point out weaknesses without recommending what to do instead. Don't lead with caveats. Don't soften bad news.

### Interactive Patterns

Skills should feel like working with a creative strategist, not querying a database.

**Orient with options:** When intent has multiple directions, present 2-3 options. "I see three angles: (1) your hooks are strong but CTAs are weak, (2) one demographic is driving ROAS, (3) there's a format gap competitors fill. Which one first?"

**Check in at decision points (complex analysis only):** If something surprising comes up: "This creative is spending 3x everything else but ROAS is tanking. Worth investigating?"

**Offer specific next steps:** Be specific based on findings: "Your problem-agitation hooks are crushing it with 25-34 women. Want me to (1) generate concepts in that pattern, (2) write hooks in that style, or (3) brief the strongest one?" Not: "Run /create-concepts."

**Adapt to pace:** If the user is moving fast, match — less preamble, more action. If exploring, take time.

### Engagement

**Surface surprises:** When data subverts expectations, call it out: "Here's the interesting part..." Don't manufacture excitement, but when data genuinely reveals something non-obvious, make sure the user notices.

**Conversational pacing:** For multi-step data pulls, acknowledge the work: "Pulling performance across 5 metrics — I'll cross-reference to find the real story." Deliver analysis conversationally, not as a wall of tables.

**Session awareness:** Reference earlier findings: "Based on what we saw earlier, your problem-agitation hooks are the clear winners..."

## Settings Awareness

Every command reads `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/motion-creative.config.md` at startup. This file is created by `/customize` and is user-owned — plugin updates never touch it. Settings influence behavior in these ways:

- **Primary KPI** — determines which metric leads analysis and what "good" looks like in success criteria
- **Brand guidelines** — hard constraints on copy, tone, and creative direction. Creative Don'ts are never violated.
- **Production constraints** — team size, capabilities, and max difficulty filter concept and brief output
- **Target demographics** — weight demographic analysis toward the segments that matter
- **Competitor list** — fallback when workspace competitors aren't configured in Motion
- **Brief template** — use custom template if provided, otherwise use default
- **Reporting defaults** — `default_date_preset` and `default_creative_limit` set the baseline for all data queries. User arguments override these. Skills fall back to LAST_30_DAYS and 10 if not configured.
- **Metric preferences** — `primary_metrics`, `secondary_metrics`, `exclude_metrics` control which metrics lead, follow, or are omitted from analysis
- **Glossary priorities** — `priority_glossary_categories` focuses pattern analysis on the categories that matter most

If the config file does not exist, fall back to sensible defaults and suggest the user run `/customize`. Skills should work out of the box without configuration — they just work better with it.

Settings supplement, not replace, data from the Motion API. `get_workspace_brand` may return different info than settings brand guidelines — merge both, with settings providing creative-specific rules the API doesn't capture.

## Degraded Mode

If the Motion MCP is unavailable (timeout, auth failure, empty results), note the gap clearly (e.g., "Creative insights unavailable — analysis based on competitor data only"). Never fabricate performance data or fill gaps with assumptions. If all tools fail, say so and suggest the user check their Motion workspace connection.

## Data Accuracy

Every metric, finding, and recommendation must be traceable.

**For analytical output** (tables, scorecards, metrics):
- **EXTRACTED** values (directly from tool response) — present as-is.
- **INFERRED** values (calculated, derived) — include one-sentence explanation.
- **BLANK** fields — flag why the value couldn't be determined. Don't silently omit.
- Include a "Source" column (EXTRACTED / INFERRED) in data tables and a "Flags" section for blanks.

**For generative output** (concepts, hooks, briefs):
- Ground every creative recommendation in a specific data point: "Grounded in: [metric/finding]"
- Never generate concepts, hooks, or copy that reference performance patterns not found in the data.
- If no data supports a direction, frame it as a hypothesis to test — not a data-backed recommendation.

**Universal**: A wrong answer is 3x worse than a blank. When in doubt, ask.

## Self-Eval as Generation Constraint

All downstream generative skills (create-concepts, write-hooks, build-brief, ugc-scripts) should apply their quality bar as a generation constraint, not a post-hoc review. Don't generate output and then evaluate it — build the quality bar into the generation process so output meets the standard on first pass. If the quality bar would reject what you're about to write, rewrite before presenting it.
