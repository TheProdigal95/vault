# Find Iteration Opportunities

Identify what's working, what's dying, and what specific iterations to test next. Every iteration card is specific enough to brief immediately.

---

## Phase 0: Orient

1. **Acknowledge**: "I'll identify what's fatiguing and suggest specific iterations to test."
2. **Ask if needed**: "Any specific creatives you want to focus on, or should I scan everything and find the opportunities?"
3. **Connected workflow**: After finding iterations, you can brief one (`/build-brief`), write hooks for it (`/write-hooks`), or analyze the original ad (`/analyze-ad`).

If the user already specified what they want to iterate on, skip questions.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### 1a. Parse Arguments

- **`--datePreset`**: Analysis window. Default: `LAST_30_DAYS`.
- **`--limit`**: Max creatives per metric. Default: `10`.

### 1b. Load Context

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/motion-creative.config.md` for primary KPI, brand guidelines, production constraints, competitors. If the file does not exist, use these defaults and suggest the user run `/customize`:
   - `primary_kpi`: use goalMetric from first `get_creative_insights` response
   - `default_date_preset`: LAST_30_DAYS
   - `default_creative_limit`: 10
   - `priority_glossary_categories`: use all
   - Brand guidelines + competitors: pull from Motion API
2. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../creative-strategist/SKILL.md` for methodology.
3. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../creative-strategist/references/performance-metrics.md` for metric interpretation.
4. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../creative-strategist/references/concept-standards.md` for quality bar.
5. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/creative-diversity.md` for diversity audit methodology, exploitation vs exploration framework, and "What to Build Next" prioritization.
6. Use `default_date_preset` from settings as the datePreset for all calls unless the user provided a `--datePreset` argument. Use `default_creative_limit` from settings as the limit unless the user provided a `--limit` argument.
7. If settings specify `priority_glossary_categories`, prioritize those categories in taxonomy analysis and gap detection.

---

## Phase 2: Data Collection

**The SPEND call must come first** (it returns goalMetric and spendThreshold). Then dispatch remaining calls in parallel.

1. `get_auth_context()` — resolve workspace
2. `get_creative_insights(workspaceId, insightType="SPEND", datePreset, limit, withAggregatedInsights=true)` — spend allocation

→ Extract `goalMetric` and `spendThreshold` from the response. Use goalMetric for all efficiency-sorted calls.

3. `get_creative_insights(workspaceId, insightType=goalMetric, datePreset, limit)` — efficiency leaders by workspace goal metric
4. `get_creative_insights(workspaceId, insightType="SCALING", datePreset, limit)` — momentum
5. For hook rate leaders: filter SPEND results (call #1) to video creatives and sort by `thumbstop_ratio` descending. Do NOT use insightType="HOOK" — it returns the same ranking as SCALING.
6. `get_glossary_values(workspaceId, includeCreativeIds=true)` — creative taxonomy
7. `get_demographic_breakdown(workspaceId, datePreset)` — audience breakdown
8. `get_workspace_brand(workspaceId)` — brand context
9. `get_workspace_competitors(workspaceId)` — for competitor reference

Then for top 2-3 competitors:
10. `get_inspo_creatives(brandId, workspaceId, limit=5, sort="NEWEST", launchDate="LAST_30_DAYS")` + `get_inspo_brand_context(brandId, workspaceId)`

---

## Phase 3: Analysis

### 3a. Identify Candidates

**Top performers** — Strong goalMetric + meaningful spend. Proven creatives worth iterating to extend their life.

**Fatiguing creatives** — Were scaling but now declining, or high spend with dropping goalMetric. Need a refresh before they burn out.

**Hidden gems** — Strong goalMetric but low spend. Underexploited — iterate to help them scale.

**High-hook/low-convert** — Great thumbstop but poor goalMetric. The hook works, the body doesn't.

### 3b. Diagnose What's Working (Top Performers)

Pull transcripts for the top 3-5 performers (max 5-8 total calls). Prioritize variety and highest goalMetric.

Cross-reference with glossary tags:
- What hook approach are they using?
- What format/visual structure?
- What messaging angle?
- Which demographic segment responds best?

### 3c. Diagnose What's Fatiguing

For declining creatives, determine the cause:

- **Hook fatigue?** HOOK rate dropping → same audience has seen the opening too many times
- **Audience saturation?** SCALING declining → exhausted the target segment
- **Format staleness?** All top performers share a format competitors have also adopted
- **Messaging wear-out?** Same angle repeated across multiple creatives

### 3d. Map the Iteration Matrix

Using the Creative Strategy Engine framework and glossary taxonomy:
- Which pain × persona × awareness stage combinations are working?
- Which haven't been tried?
- What tag combinations exist in winners but not in the broader catalog?
- Where can you take a winning element and combine it with something untested?

### 3e. Diversity Audit

Reference `references/creative-diversity.md` for the full methodology. Assess the portfolio across five dimensions:

- **Coverage**: How many distinct pain/desire buckets, personas, awareness stages, and messaging angles are represented?
- **Concentration**: What % of spend or top performers fall into a single matrix cell? A single pain/desire bucket? A single awareness stage? Multiple winners in the same cell = proven but unexpanded. All winners at Stage 4-5 = harvesting, not building demand.
- **Format spread**: How many distinct asset types and visual formats? Is one format carrying disproportionate weight?
- **Hook diversity**: Across top performers, how many distinct hook tactics and psychological triggers? If all winners use the same tactic, that is a signal — either untested alternatives or genuine dominance.
- **Stage balance**: TOFU (Stage 1-2) vs MOFU (Stage 3) vs BOFU (Stage 4-5) coverage. All bottom-funnel = cannot scale.

Map existing creative back onto the matrix. Look for concentration signals (everything that works is in one region) and gap signals (entire pain/desire buckets, personas, or stages with no representation).

### 3f. Exploitation vs Exploration Assessment

Assess whether the portfolio is balanced between deepening proven territory and expanding into new territory.

**Exploitation** (iterating on proven): Lower risk, predictable returns, but limited growth ceiling.
**Exploration** (testing new matrix cells): Higher variance, but required for growth.

**Warning signs of too much exploitation:**
- All new creative is a variation of the same concept
- The winning angle hasn't changed in months
- Top performers are all in the same matrix cell
- Account looks efficient but isn't growing

**Warning signs of too much exploration:**
- No pattern has emerged across tests
- Many one-off concepts, no consistent winners
- Account is learning but not compounding

A healthy portfolio does both — most volume runs on proven angles while a consistent portion tests new territory. Call out which direction the current portfolio skews and what the implication is.

---

## Phase 4: Generate Iteration Cards

For each opportunity, produce a structured card:

### Iteration Card Format

**Source Creative**: Name/ID of the creative being iterated on
**What's Working**: Specific element to preserve — hook, format, angle, audience
**Iteration Type**: One of:
- **Hook Refresh** — New opening on same body/format
- **Format Swap** — Same message in a different creative format
- **Audience Pivot** — Same creative approach for a different demographic or persona
- **Messaging Angle Shift** — New angle on the same pain/desire
- **Full Refresh** — New concept inspired by what made the original work

**Specific Change**: Exactly what to change and what to keep
**Target Audience**: Who this iteration targets (same or new segment)
**New Hook** (if applicable): Verbatim opening line
**Why This Iteration**: Data-grounded rationale — connect to a performance finding or taxonomy gap
**Expected Impact**: What metric should improve and why
**Production Difficulty**: Low / Medium / High

### Generation Rules

- Generate 5-8 iteration cards total
- Each must be specific enough to brief immediately
- Mix of iteration types (don't generate 5 hook refreshes)
- At least 1 card for a fatiguing creative, 1 for a hidden gem, 1 for a top performer
- Reference competitor approaches where relevant (learn, don't copy)

### What to Build Next — Prioritization

Use the diversity audit and iteration matrix to prioritize cards in this order:

1. **Proven cells with no recent creative** — Build more here first. You know it works; you are leaving demand uncaptured.
2. **Adjacent cells to winners** — Similar persona or pain/desire bucket to a winner but a slightly different intersection. Likely responsive, lower risk to test.
3. **Completely untested cells** — Highest uncertainty, but required for expansion. Worth running smaller tests to qualify before scaling.
4. **Missing funnel stages** — If Stage 1-2 is absent and budget allows, this is a structural gap worth closing. Top-of-funnel coverage is what makes scaling possible.

Prioritize by: known signal first, adjacent hypotheses second, net-new exploration third. Every iteration card should cite which bucket it falls into.
