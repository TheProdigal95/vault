# Weekly Performance Slide Deck

Generate a week-over-week creative performance analysis as a presentation-ready slide deck. The deck tells a story — it's not a data dump.

---

## Phase 0: Orient

1. **Acknowledge**: "Building your week-over-week creative performance deck."
2. **Ask format**: "HTML slide deck, Notion, or Slack? Anything specific you want highlighted?"
3. **Connected workflow**: After the deck, you can dive into specific ads (`/analyze-ad`), find iterations on fatiguing creatives (`/find-iterations`), or generate concepts to fill gaps (`/create-concepts`).

If the user already specified the format, skip the question and build.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### 1a. Parse Arguments

- **`--output`**: Where to deliver the report. Default: `auto` (ask the user).
  - `html` — Self-contained HTML with CSS scroll-snap
  - `notion` — Structured document with headings, tables, callout blocks
  - `slack` — Concise highlights post (max 300 words)
  - `pdf` — Print-optimized HTML with page breaks
  - `auto` — Ask the user before building

### 1b. Load Context

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/motion-creative.config.md` for org-specific config. If the file does not exist, use these defaults and suggest the user run `/customize`:
   - `primary_kpi`: use goalMetric from first `get_creative_insights` response
   - `demographic_focus`: both
   - `primary_metrics` / `secondary_metrics` / `exclude_metrics`: auto-detect
   - Brand guidelines: pull from `get_workspace_brand`
2. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../creative-strategist/SKILL.md` for methodology.
3. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../creative-strategist/references/performance-metrics.md` for metric definitions.
4. If settings contain `primary_metrics`, ensure those metrics lead the WoW analysis. If `exclude_metrics`, omit from all comparisons.

### 1c. Resolve Date Windows

Calculate two non-overlapping 7-day windows ending **yesterday** (never include today — partial data distorts metrics):
- **This week**: start = 8 days ago, end = yesterday
- **Last week**: start = 15 days ago, end = 9 days ago

Use YYYY-MM-DD format.

---

## Phase 2: Data Collection

### 2a. Prerequisites (Strict Sequence)

Call `get_auth_context()` → resolve workspaceId.

The first `get_creative_insights` response includes `goalMetric` (the workspace's preferred efficiency metric) and `spendThreshold` (minimum spend for statistical significance). Extract both. The goalMetric is the primary KPI for the entire deck.

Defaults if unavailable: settings `primary_kpi` for metric, $100 for threshold.

### 2b. Parallel Data Pulls

Once you have workspaceId and goalMetric, dispatch all in parallel:

1. **Brand context**: `get_workspace_brand(workspaceId)` — brand voice, creative constraints
2. **This week's creatives**: `get_creative_insights(workspaceId, insightType="SPEND", datePreset="CUSTOM", startDate="{this_week_start}", endDate="{this_week_end}", limit=20, withAggregatedInsights=true)`
3. **Last week's creatives**: `get_creative_insights(workspaceId, insightType="SPEND", datePreset="CUSTOM", startDate="{last_week_start}", endDate="{last_week_end}", limit=20, withAggregatedInsights=true)`
4. **Demographics**: `get_demographic_breakdown(workspaceId, datePreset="LAST_14_DAYS")` — 14-day aggregate (tool doesn't support custom ranges). Note this limitation.
5. **Glossary taxonomy**: `get_glossary_values(workspaceId, includeCreativeIds=true)`

### 2c. After Insights Return

Call `get_creative_summary` for the top 10 creatives by spend (this week) to get verbatim hooks and headlines. Use `spokenHook` for video, `headline` for static. Prefer `spokenHook` > `textOverlayHook` > `headline`.

### 2d. Derive Trends

Compare `aggregatedInsights` from both weeks for account-level WoW deltas: spend, goalMetric, CTR, CPA, thumbstop, impressions.

### 2e. Identify Launches

From this week's creatives, filter any with `launchDate` within the current week window. These are newly launched tests.

### 2f. Validate Before Proceeding

- If either pull returns fewer than 5 creatives above the spend threshold, flag the thin dataset and adjust scope.
- If the preferred metric has no usable values, fall back to spend-ranked order and state that explicitly.

---

## Phase 3: Detect the Week Type

Before building slides, classify the week. This determines the narrative arc. Evaluate in order, pick the first that fits:

**Breakout** — A creative that wasn't in last week's top 20 appeared in this week's top 10 AND outperforms account averages on goalMetric. Story: what's new and why it's working.

**Fatigue** — 3+ of last week's top 10 dropped out or declined >20% on goalMetric, AND nothing new replaced them at comparable efficiency. Story: what's dying and what needs to replace it.

**Shift** — The composition of the top 20 changed meaningfully: a different format, messaging angle, or demographic segment now dominates. Story: the direction change.

**Launch** — 5+ new creatives (launched within current week) appear with meaningful spend. Story: early reads on fresh creative.

**Steady** — None of the above. Story: the hidden signal everyone else would miss — the quiet riser, the subtle pattern, or the fatigue that hasn't hit yet.

---

## Phase 4: Build the Analysis

### 4a. Creative-Level Diff

For every creative in either week's top 20:
- Present in last week's top 20? This week's? Both? New? Dropped?
- Delta on: spend, goalMetric, CTR, thumbstop (if video)
- Verbatim hook/headline from `get_creative_summary`
- Glossary tags — how does its profile compare to the rest of the top 20?

### 4b. Pattern Extraction

Across both weeks' top performers:
- Tag combinations over-represented this week vs last
- What disappeared from the top 20?
- Multi-attribute clusters in winners (e.g., UGC + problem-first hook + testimonial)?
- What's absent from top performers that exists in the portfolio? (untested directions)

### 4c. Behavioral Interpretation

Every finding must answer "so what?" — translate metrics into viewer behavior:

| Signal | What It Means |
|---|---|
| High hook rate (thumbstop_ratio) + high hold rate (video_thruplay_ratio) | Opening promises and delivers. Viewers feel rewarded. |
| High hook rate (thumbstop_ratio) + low hold rate (video_thruplay_ratio) | Hook grabs but middle doesn't pay off. Viewers feel baited. If video_thruplay_ratio is unavailable, use video retention percentiles (video_p25/p50/p75_watched_ratio) to assess hold. |
| High CTR + low conversion | Ad sells the click but landing page doesn't close. |
| Spend increasing | Algorithm found evidence it works. Winning auctions. |
| Spend decreasing | Creative exhausting its audience or losing auctions. |
| High goalMetric + low spend | Algorithm found a pocket that works but can't scale it. |
| High spend + declining goalMetric | Budget leak. More urgent than any low-spend underperformer. |

Lead with the human reaction, support with the number.

### 4d. Demographic Layer

From 14-day aggregate: which segments drive spend and efficiency? Flag segments with >15% spend share or >20% goalMetric deviation. Note the 14-day limitation.

### 4e. Apply Brand Context

Frame everything through brand context:
- Write slide headlines in brand voice
- Filter recommendations against creative constraints
- If a winning pattern conflicts with brand guidelines, flag the tension

---

## Phase 5: Build the Slide Deck

Output as self-contained HTML. Each slide is a full-viewport section with CSS scroll-snap.

### Design Principles

- **The creative IS the slide.** Ads shown large (40-50% of slide area). Use `creativeUrl` as image/video source.
- **One insight per slide.** If you need more than 20 words of body text, the slide is doing too much.
- **Metrics are badges, not headlines.** Small contextual labels showing WoW delta.
- **Quote actual hooks/headlines.** Large type near the creative card.
- **Color-code direction.** Green for improvement, red for decline, neutral for flat.
- **Speaker notes.** Collapsible footer bar, 2-3 sentences with the behavioral "why."

### Slide Arc

**Slide 1: This Week**
Account-level WoW snapshot. Grounds the entire deck.
- Brand name, date range, week type as subtitle
- WoW deltas: total spend, impressions, goalMetric, CPA, CTR, thumbstop
- Color-coded arrows
- One framing sentence
- Week type framing line:
  - Breakout: "A new creative broke into the top 5"
  - Fatigue: "Multiple top performers are declining"
  - Shift: "The creative mix changed meaningfully"
  - Launch: "[N] new creatives entered the dataset"
  - Steady: "Stable surface, but there's a signal underneath"

**Slides 2-3: Winners & Losers** (1-2 slides)
The creatives driving the week's story. Per creative (2-4 per slide):
- Actual hook/headline in large type
- One metric badge: the WoW delta
- One line: what the creative does to the viewer

Feature selection by week type:
- Breakout: new risers vs what they displaced
- Fatigue: declining creatives, what originally made them work
- Shift: old vs new top performers
- Launch: highest-spend new creatives by signal strength
- Steady: hidden gem vs "safe" top performers

**Slide (conditional): Launches**
Include if 1+ creatives launched this week. Skip otherwise.
- Each launched creative: thumbnail, hook text, early metrics
- Label all metrics as "early reads"
- Group: promising, neutral, concerning

**Slide: Patterns**
One slide connecting evidence into a creative thesis.
- Not: "Hook Tactic: Problem-First increased 34%"
- Instead: "The audience is responding to ads that lead with a flaw"
- Name multi-attribute recipes if emerging
- Include demographic signal if relevant

**Slide: What's Next**
Always the final slide. 2-3 specific creative directions for next week.
Each must:
- Name format, hook approach, messaging angle
- Trace back to a finding from earlier slides
- Be specific enough to brief
- Not: "Test more UGC"
- Instead: "Shoot 2-3 confessional UGC pieces where the creator admits a problem with the product before explaining why they kept it"

### Conditional Adjustments

- Both Winners & Losers show same pattern → collapse to 1 slide
- Patterns has no clear thesis → replace with "What to Watch"
- Demographics show no meaningful deviation → don't force demographic angle
- Launches has 5+ creatives → expand to 2 slides
- **Maximum 6 slides.** If you need more, you're saying too much.

## Phase 6: Output

### Delivery

If `--output` is `auto`, ask: "Where would you like this report? I can build it as a slide deck, Notion page, Slack post, or shareable link."

### Response

Brief intro (1-2 sentences: the week type and biggest insight), then present the artifact.

### Follow-Up

Tied to week type:
- Breakout: "Want me to build concepts that extend this pattern?"
- Fatigue: "Want me to generate fresh directions to fill the gap?"
- Shift: "Want me to dig into what's driving the shift?"
- Launch: "Want me to tear down the strongest new launch?"
- Steady: "Want me to explore that hidden signal further?"

---

## Constraints

- Never fabricate creative IDs, metric values, or hook text
- Never include creatives below spend threshold unless they're hidden gems
- Never make budget allocation, audience targeting, or campaign structure recommendations — this is a creative strategy deck, not a media plan
- Never blend 7-day creative data with 14-day demographic data without flagging
- Never use tables as primary slide content
- If data is thin, say so plainly
- Use goalMetric consistently — never default to ROAS unless that IS the goalMetric

## Degraded Mode

If any tool call fails:
- Note the gap explicitly
- Never fabricate performance data
- If get_creative_insights fails entirely, stop and report
- If demographics or glossary fail, proceed with creative-level analysis only
- Partial analysis with clear caveats > fabricated complete one
